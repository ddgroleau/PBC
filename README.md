# PBC

### I started this project as a way to test out the "package by component" architectural pattern as described by Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin in his book "Clean Architecture". He describes this pattern as an alternative to the onion pattern or as a better way to transition to microservices in the future if the need arises.

Cooking app with Webscraping service. Building with Blazor WebAssembly / .Net Core. Work in progress.
